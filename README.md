# Status changes to "QA Testing" Notifications

GitHub doesn't provide a built-in way to send notifications if the status is changing. This
GitHub Action aims to address this by allowing you to manage the changes within a central GitHub project.

## Introduction

This GitHub Action allows you to manage status changes for issues in a central GitHub project. It integrates with a custom
text field (status) that you can add to your GitHub project board. 

There are two ways to send notifications:
1. With comments: Everyone which is subscribed to the issue will receive email notification when comment is placed.
2. With emails: Assignees will receive email directly from the action. 

### Prerequisites

Before you can start using this GitHub Action, you'll need to ensure you have the following:

1. A GitHub repository where you want to enable this action.
2. A GitHub project board with a custom status field added.
3. A Token (Classic) with permissions to repo:*, read:user, user:email, read:project

### Examples

#### Expiring Issues With Comment
To set up QA Testing status change comment notifications, you'll need to create or update a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository. Below is
an example of a workflow YAML file:

```yaml
name: 'Notify Status Change to QA Testing with Comment'

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  notify_status_change::
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check status change and add a comment
        uses: emily-lambrou/status_changes_to_qatesting@latest
        with:
          gh_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          project_number: 2
          status_field_name: "Status"
          notification_type: "comment"
          notify_for: "status_change_to_qatesting"
```

#### Expiring Issues With Email
To set up QA Testing change status email notifications, you'll need to create or update a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository. Below is
an example of a workflow YAML file:

```yaml
name: 'Notify Status Change to QA Testing with Email'

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  notify_status_change:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check status change and send email to assignees
        uses: emily-lambrou/status_changes_to_qatesting@latest
        with:
          gh_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          project_number: 2
          status_field_name: "Status"
          notification_type: "email"
          notify_for: "status_change_to_qatesting"
          smtp_server: smtp.example.com  # Replace with your SMTP server
          smtp_port: 587  # Replace with your SMTP port
          smtp_username: ${{ secrets.SMTP_USERNAME }}
          smtp_password: ${{ secrets.SMTP_PASSWORD }}
          smtp_from_email: github@example.com  # Replace with your sender email    
```
